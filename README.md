# üìå Comprehensive Roadmap for Security & Automation Tool
This roadmap outlines a structured development plan, where the user selects a security category, then picks a sub-function, and follows an interactive, modular, hierarchical approach. The tool will be built in an object-oriented, scalable, and secure manner.

## üìç High-Level Roadmap
[1] Defensive Security (6 Modules)  
[2] Offensive Security (6 Modules)  
[3] Remote Administration & Automation (4 Modules)  
- Advanced Features (Cross-Platform, Scalability, Stealth, API Integration, Decentralization) - Implemented by default.  
- Each category will be built step-by-step, ensuring a hierarchical menu-driven structure.  

---
### üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Building the User Selection System
### User Flow
Select Category  
[1] Defensive Security  
[2] Offensive Security  
[3] Remote Administration & Automation  

Select a Sub-Function  
- Example: If the user selects [1] Defensive Security, a second menu appears with [1-6] Defensive Security modules.  
- The user chooses one, inputs required parameters, and the system executes it.  

### Process Execution  
- Each function will be built as an independent module with logging, error handling, and secure communication.

### üìå Step 1: Implementing User Selection System
- The first task is to allow the user to select a category and display corresponding functions.  
### User Flow  
Welcome to the Security & Automation Tool!  
[1] Defensive Security  
[2] Offensive Security  
[3] Remote Administration & Automation 
[4] Exit  
  
If the user selects [1] Defensive Security, show:  
[1] Real-Time Secure Chat  
[2] Intrusion Detection Sensor  
[3] Automated Security Alerting  
[4] File Integrity Monitoring  
[5] Secure Encrypted File Transfer  
[6] Honeypot Deployment  
[7] Back
