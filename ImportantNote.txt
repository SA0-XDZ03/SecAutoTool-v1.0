Defense Security
Intrusion Detection Sensor
- Monitor incoming/outgoing traffic and report anomalies to a central server.
- Log and analyze packet data for potential threats.

Real-Time Secure Chat
- AES/RSA encrypted end-to-end communication.
- Authentication mechanism (username/password or certificates).
- Multi-client support.

Automated Security Alerting System
- Deploy agents across networks to monitor unauthorized access attempts.
- Collect logs from devices and send alerts.

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) System
- Clients scan system files for unauthorized changes and report to the server.
- Use cryptographic hashing to verify file integrity.

Secure Encrypted File Transfer
- Use TLS/SSL to encrypt file transfers between clients and servers.
- Implement chunk-based transfer to prevent loss.

Honeypot Deployment
- Deploy fake servers to lure and detect attackers.
- Capture malicious activities and analyze attacker behavior.
